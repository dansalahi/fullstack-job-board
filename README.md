<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

It is true that there are a lot of job finding platforms out there, but what makes our platform different is its simplicity and efficiency. Finding a job on Job Finder is enjoyable due to its excellent features and UI/UX Design.

Here's why:
* Our goal is to show you the best and most suitable offers.
* Using our powerful job search box, you can find the perfect job.
* You can share your experience of working with different companies or use the experience of others.

Of course, It is not the best platform yet, but we are adding new features every day to make it the best job finder platform you've ever seen.

### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
